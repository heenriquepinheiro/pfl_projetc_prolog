# Project-l05gr04 - PacQuestions

In this fun and exciting game, you should help Pac find the three different keys that will set him free. Pac is stuck in a room filled with monsters and if these
monsters catch up to him,  he'll die, therefore, you will lose the game. Everytime you find a key, you will have to answer a riddle. If your answer is the correct
one, you can continue collecting keys normally. However, if your answer is wrong, the velocity of the monsters will increase. When you find the last (third) 
key and answer the question, you need to go to the door that will free Pac.
